# Command Reference

You can always view a list of commands within the game by typing `HELP`. You can also get more information about any command by typing `HELP` and then the command name, e.g. `HELP LOOK`.

The list of commands below is fairly exhaustive, but there are other commands not documented here. Some just aren’t significant enough to document, while others are _secret_. You can always experiment and try things out—you never know what you’ll discover.

Note: commands are shown in capital letters to make them stand out, but you can type them any way you’d like.
