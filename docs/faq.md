# Frequently Asked Questions

#### How does this even work?
It’s pretty simple! You type commands at the prompt (>). Commands can be simple verbs (like “look”) or noun + verb combinations (like "take a banana"). The parser interprets your command and then tells you what happens. You’ll see what other people are doing in real time as well.

#### So that’s it? You just type and read stuff?
Yep, that’s it.

#### Thanks, I hate it.
That’s OK. It’s not for everyone.

#### Who made this?
Terminal Lands is produced by [Neatnik](https://neatnik.net). [Adam Newbold](https://adam.lol) is the sole developer.

#### Can you add graphics?
I’d rather not. This is all about [text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_game)!
