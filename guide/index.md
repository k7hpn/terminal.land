# Welcome

Greetings, traveler! You’ve arrived in Terminal Land, where your awesome adventure awaits!

This documentation will help you with just about every aspect of the game, though it’s a work in progress. Thanks for your patience as things are added and updated during game development.

## What is Terminal Land?

Terminal Land is a multiplayer interactive fiction game that you can play in your browser. Everything happens in text: you type commands to do things, and then read the results of your actions (and other people’s actions, too). The graphics engine is one of the most sophisticated of its kind, powered entirely within your own imagination.
