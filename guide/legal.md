# Terms of Use & Privacy Policy

_This page was created on September 28, 2020. You can view a full history of all changes [here](https://github.com/neatnik/terminal.land/commits/main/docs/legal)._

Hello! üëã This page contains our [Terms of Use](#terms-of-use) and [Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy). Please read them over carefully. You must agree to both before registering with Terminal Land, and your use of Terminal Land indicates your ongoing agreement to these items.

First, let‚Äôs cover some key rules. We have just three:

## Be kind and play nicely

This is a game, and as such it‚Äôs meant for people to have fun. Some people‚Äôs idea of fun is speaking or behaving in a way ruins the fun for other people, and that‚Äôs just not welcome here. We‚Äôre not going to list out all of the things that aren‚Äôt allowed‚Äîthose kinds of lists only create the idea that anything omitted is fair game‚Äîso we‚Äôre going to have to ask you to use good judgement and common sense.

## One player account per person

In order to maintain trust among our player population and to keep the game economy balanced, player accounts are limited to one per person. Please don‚Äôt create multiple accounts.

## Report issues responsibly

Terminal land is under ongoing development, and bugs or other technical issues are inevitable. If you encounter an issue, please report it (either via a public [issue](https://github.com/neatnik/terminal.land/issues/new) or via the in-game `BUG` command. If you discover a security vulnerability or other game-breaking exploit, please report it responsibly via security@terminal.land. Don‚Äôt abuse exploits just because you can; do the right thing and let us know about them.
