# Frequently Asked Questions

#### How does this even work?
It’s really simple! You type commands at the prompt (`>`). Commands can be simple verbs (like “look”) or noun + verb combinations (like "take a banana"). The parser interprets your command and then tells you what happens. You’ll see what other people are doing in real time as well.

#### So that’s it? You just type and read stuff?
Yep, that’s it. It’s glorious

#### Thanks, I hate it.
That’s OK. It’s not for everyone.

#### Who made this?
Terminal Land is produced by [Neatnik](https://neatnik.net).  The sole developer is [Adam Newbold](https://adam.lol). This is a labor of love.

#### Can you add graphics?
No, this is a [text-based game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_game). Like a book, the graphics are in your mind!

#### Is this open source? Can I see the code?
The core game engine and parser are not open source, but other aspects of the site (like the [Electron client](https://github.com/neatnik/terminal.land/tree/main/clients/electron), the [Guide](https://github.com/neatnik/terminal.land/tree/main/guide), our [tiny custom CMS](https://github.com/neatnik/term), our [scripting language](https://github.com/neatnik/tingl), and our [custom typeface](https://github.com/neatnik/terminal-land-mono) are).
