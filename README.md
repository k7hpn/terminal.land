## About

This is a different kind of game, one in which interactions are purely text-based and the graphics exist solely in your mind. It might not be your cup of tea, but that’s OK—it’s not for everyone. ☺️

If you like [interactive fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction), you might enjoy Terminal Land. And if you like spending time in a terminal, you might love it.

## Documentation

All information about the game can be found in the [Guide](https://guide.terminal.land), at https://guide.terminal.land. Feel free to suggest additions or changes in GitHub.
