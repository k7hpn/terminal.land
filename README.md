## About

This is a different kind of game, one in which the action takes the form of text and the graphics exist only in your mind. It might not be your cup of tea, but that’s OK—nobody’s forcing you to drink anything here. ☺️

If you’ve ever played [interactive fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction) (often called “text adventure” games), you might like Terminal Land. And if you enjoy spending time in a terminal, you might love it.

## Docs

All information about the game can be found in the [Docs](https://docs.terminal.land), which are currently being built out.
