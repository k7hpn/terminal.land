# Electron Client

The [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) client can run on most common operating systems, and features Discord integration (which is pretty cool!). Beyond the Discord integration and the convenience of a dedicated app, there isnâ€™t much difference between this client and the [web version](https://terminal.land).

You can view the [latest release](https://github.com/neatnik/terminal.land/releases/latest) and download the binaries for your preferred OS.
